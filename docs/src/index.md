## Overview

Operator Algebra provides a minimalist framework to construct Hamiltonians of arbitrary quantum systems with discrete Hilbert spaces efficiently. In particular, this package allows for the creation of the Hamiltonians operator structure without allocating large matrices, while providing the full flexibility of arithmetic operations on the algebraic ring of operators. Compared to other similar projects, OperatorAlgebra.jl allows for highly flexible indexing, where Julia's native multiple dispatched is leveraged to allow for creative implementations. OperatorAlgebra.jl is not a solution to your problems, but rather a toolbox that will help you to write simple, efficient and short codes in the familiar language of blackbord quantum mechanics.

## Key Features

- **Create Operators**:
  - Add and multiply objects representing the abstract operators
  - Define objects representing your custom, abstract operators.
  - Use a flexible description of your basis to convert to the matrix representation of the operators.

- **Matrix representation**:
  - Easily convert your abstract operators into different Matrix representations.
  - Initialize the matrix efficiently as sparse, dense or memory-less.

## Quick Example

```julia
using OperatorAlgebra

# Define Pauli operators on different sites
σx = Op(PAULI_X, 1)
σz = Op(PAULI_Z, 2)

# Build a Hamiltonian
H = σx + σz + 0.5 * σx * σz

# Convert to sparse matrix
basis = [1, 2]
H_matrix = sparse(H, basis)

# Apply to a product state
state = [[1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0]]  # |00⟩
new_state = apply(σx, state)       # |10⟩
```

## Installation

Since this is a local package, you can add it in development mode:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.develop(path="/path/to/operator_algebra")
```
